% this plant has a RHP-zero at s = 0:5
% The RHP-zero limits the achievable bandwidth and so the crossover 
% region (defined as the frequencies between wc and w180) will be at about 0:5rad/s. We require
% the system to have one integrator (type 1system), and therefore a reasonable approach is to
% let the loop transfer function have a slope of 1at low frequencies, and then to roll off with a
% higher slope at frequencies beyond 0:5rad/s.
